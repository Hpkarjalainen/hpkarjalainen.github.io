## My simple website for cloud services-course assignment
### The requirements for this bundle E from [Cloud Services Course](https://tl.oamk.fi/cloudservices/) is to make a website using github pages, and use a handful of Github flavour markdown features to format the webpage

##### ***Link to this page can be found in my learning diary***

Let´s see some example of code blocks that can be used in github pages:

>Examples from OAMK java course


First Example:

```
@Override
    public void lend(String lender) {
        super.lend(lender);
        super.loanTime = 7;
    }
```

Second example;

```
for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            soft1.takeHit();
            tough1.takeHit();
        }
```

 #### The requirements stated that I need to use a handful of markdown features. In case that those features above are not enough, let´s explore a few more:

I have created an another text file inside this repository. You can check it out [here](/newText.md)

One example of a list (of the courses we are ongoing right now):

- Jave Programming
* Cloud Services
* Web development

It is also possble to use emojis, se let´s see a few:
